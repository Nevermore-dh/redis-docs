To [monitor go-redis performance](go-redis-monitoring.md), you can use OpenTelemetry instrumentation
that comes with go-redis and Uptrace.

Uptrace is an open source [DataDog competitor](https://uptrace.dev/blog/datadog-competitors.html)
that supports [OpenTelemetry tracing](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/distributed-tracing.html),
[OpenTelemetry metrics](https://uptrace.dev/opentelemetry/metrics.html), and logs. You can use it to
monitor applications and set up automatic alerts to receive notifications via email, Slack,
Telegram, and more.
